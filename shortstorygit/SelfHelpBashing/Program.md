# A Sarcastic Guide to Coding Interviews

----
## Motivation
As just about anyone will tell you, an in-person coding interview is one of the most fun experiences you'll have in your life - it's more enjoyable than Disneyland, more exciting than an EDM concert, and more fulfilling than a conference.  *It's also more expensive than all three combined*, and it's not really an option at this point in time.  That's why I started playing Leetcode.

## Leetcode Gameplay
So to be clear, I'm still pretty trash at Leetcode (as well as HackerRank, its rival, which features a more forgiving ladder system but a far more confusing layout).  According to their ranking system, I'm actually still Bronze League.

That being said, there are a few things I've picked up over the last few months

1. The open world is *massive*.  They've introduced thousands of hours of gameplay, and that's without even bothering to pay the $13 a month for Leetcode Premium
2. They've introduced tons of languages to choose from - you can choose Kotlin, SQL, binary, superSQL, Lisp...and even PHP!  I know, that last one made me lose my mind
3. There have been tons of unit updates.  Just last week they introduced something to C++ called the vector, and *damn*, that thing is amazing! It's like an array except you can just *keep adding to it*.

## Choosing a Language
Even though you have several hundred languages to choose from, the only three that are really used in competitive gameplay are C++, Java, and Python.  Lots of people also use JavaScript, which would have confused me had it not been for the fact that JavaScript currently has the entire world wide web at gunpoint and hostage negotiations are going very poorly.

Use Kotlin only if you want to demonstrate how much you hate Oracle, and use Go only if you don't think the mascot is weird.

# C++

This is the language I have the most experience with, which *in no way* means it's my favorite or even that I'm good at it.  To be any good at all you have to read the strategy guide, *Effective C++*, followed by *Exceptional C++*.  I really think this takes the fun out of it, though, and I'm more of a casual gamer.

The learning curve is pretty steep.  You have to really micro your units well, and you get lots more control than you would in a language like Java.  The speeds are also really impressive, and it supports multi-threading, making it an ideal choice for people who want to dominate in the late game.

Some people still prefer to play in C, and there have been tons of toxic arguments about that in the community.  Personally, I just like the feel of C++ more and want to see some new/delete combinations and namespaces.  To be honest, I just don't feel at home without seeing pairs::of::colors over everything.

# Java

This language is an interesting one.  It has a really unique way of doing builds, meaning players use a common strategy of settings tons of build points and constructing units from a variety of different places.  The big drawback, though, is it's really hard to type the variables.  I actually have a really impressive APM, and even I get frustrated by how long it takes to write out some of the variable names.

If you can use C++, you can probably transition between the two pretty easily.  They do have lots of interesting differences if you really wanna get into that, though.

All in all, I think this is probably more forgiving than C++

# Python

I don't really use Python at all and don't know much about it, but I fight opponents who use it constantly and keep getting my ass kicked.  Seriously, Python devs can lay down entire code bases before I've even finished downloading VSCode.

To be honest, it confuses the hell out of me.  Indentation matters.  I can't really tell what does what because of how it's typed.  Usually by the time I finally figure it out, my opponent's already wiped out my entire base and it's GG.

Doesn't help when I find out the python dev was actually a 12-year-old who learned to code last Thursday.

**Bottom Line: Code in whatever you feel comfortable with, but it should probably be C++, Java, Python, or whatever that other language I said was**

## Common Strategies

Shoot, I might have to break this up into another post.  Here are strategies people are using now that transcend language choice

* **Data structure cycling**: These players just run through every data structure until they figure out which one gets the job done.  It's not the smartest strategy, but it actually gets a player further than brute force
* **Brute force**: My preferred method, which is probably why I'm still trash.  Just do things in the most obvious way possible, like a kid who opens a sorted deck of cards and decides to find the Ace of spades by searching through every card one by one, in order.  Plan to optimize after you brute force it.  Then don't.
* **Hashmap rush**: This is where you construct a hashmap, then just spam calls to it until you've beaten the problem into linear time submission.  Doesn't work on every problem, but I always try it anyway
* **Tree traversal**: You have to do this if you're on a tree map.  Trees are a lot of fun and roughly 89% of Leetcode players stick to them and actually do nothing else because they're just that much fun.
* **Dynamic programming**: Only the most advanced players can pull this one off.  I wouldn't even attempt it until you reach diamond league or above
* **Trash talking the interviewer**: A very effective strategy, especially in Leetcode

## Does this actually help?

Look, I'm going to be honest with you...only the top 1% of the top 1% of Leetcode players can ever hope to do this competitively.  Believe me, I used to do this in person.  It is intense.

And of course, it's also tons of fun.  I've never had more fun in my life.  You get to meet tons of people who will be your friends for the rest of your life...you get to learn all kinds of things about them, and they'll never forget you.  But if your only goal with sites like Leetcode is to make money, you're totally missing the point.

We play Leetcode for fun.  Remember to have fun!  Just try to not get addicted...once you start, it's hard to stop.  I started using an app called RescueTime, just to limit my Leetcode usage to an hour instead of going nine hours a day nonstop.

Seriously.  This game could destroy your life.

Good luck out there!  Happy coding.
