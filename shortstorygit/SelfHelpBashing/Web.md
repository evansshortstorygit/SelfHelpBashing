# A Sarcastic Guide to Web Building

----
## Introduction

----
Building websites has always been a popular pastime for high schoolers and college students, but it's really gaining traction now that it's summer and we're in lockdown.  Teenagers are building websites on the bus.  Teenagers are getting pulled over for driving while building websites.  There's a particularly dangerous game college students play in which they line up 12 shot glasses, set up laptops, and see who can build a better website as they drink.  Typically the rule is that you have to take a shot every time you npm install a new package, but the rules vary.

## Why is building websites so popular?

When you build websites, *you can do whatever you want.*  Let me say that again, *YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT*.  You can use a special REST API to retrieve new corgis every 25 minutes, and I have.  You can make a website that randomly generates a new Trump tweet using machine learning, and someone has. Here are a few slightly scary things about web development:

1. You can use something called **Github Pages** and get free hosting
2. You can generate a **Wix** site for free in just five minutes and see it hosted live
3. You can create a **Bootstrap** template that looks nice out of the box.  So please be careful if you have children, and don't let them web develop unsupervised.

I know it has a bad wrap.  Parents are really worried that their kids spend so much time building websites when they could be streaming Netflix or playing video games instead.  I get it.

But like candy, cake, and air, building websites is perfectly fine as long as you do it in moderation.

 
# Common Tools

## Vanilla

**Vanilla** refers to the standard tool set you download when you first set up web development on your computer.  You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Websites typically go much further than this, but those three things are almost always a part of the final product.

### HTML

Some programmers say HTML isn't real coding, which is strange because it can be harder than *real coding* in some ways.  Definitely different, but way too chaotic and confusing to read to be a health concern.  Go nuts on HTML.  Let your kids use it.  I guarantee they will not get addicted

### CSS

Even safer than HTML

### JavaScript

Don't let anyone under 18 use JavaScript.  As I wrote in a previous post, JavaScript has the entire world wide web held at gunpoint and hostage negotiations are not going well.  JavaScript is hard to read, harder to use, impossible to debug without unknowingly introducing errors...and really, really addicting because of how powerful it is.

## Wix, SquareSpace, and Wordpress

Some parents refer to these three things as *gateway drugs*, but it's only the last of the three that's really addicting.  For the most part, all three are pretty safe...just be careful with the third.  A little harmless dragging and dropping on a template rarely leads to longterm addiction, but a young kid on Wordpress just might find him/herself transitioning into a full-on web developer.  Under the age of 18, that just isn't safe.

## Web Frameworks

Bootstrap is a really simple to use CSS framework that looks beautiful on a variety of devices, or so they say.  I don't know, I've still managed to fk it up somehow.

There's also React, Angular, Vue.js, SuperJS.js, and js.js.  Vue.js is a favorite for many people because of how many puns it allows for.  Enjoy the Vue.  There's also a technology that goes on top of Vue called Vuetify, which was also invented to make a fun.

It's Vuetiful.


## Common Practices

These are all things people are doing at parties.  Please be very careful

* **NPM**: Web developers npm install everything but the kitchen sink and hope the malware they download fixes the bugs for them
* **PHP**: Never do this.  Just say no
* **Ruby**: A stone-based language that loves stone-based puns.  Surprisingly difficult to use on an Apple device.  Proceed with caution
* **C++**: An earlier version of me would have not thought it possible to develop a website using C++.  Can you?  Apparently.  Should you?  Probably not, as it might destroy your life and involve pointers in some way
* **Web attacking**: This is a particularly nasty practice.  Some dick did it to me in college, but I reported him and the admin banned him from our server for three hours.  It's actually illegal to do this now, but when has that ever stopped anyone?
* **Jekyll**: Looked pretty innocent to me, but it's actually extremely potent and easy to deploy.  Don't even try fking with this

## How do I avoid getting addicted?

I use an app called SelfControl.  For all but maybe one hour of each day, I block w3schools, mdn, and everything else that might pull me back.

If you can't handle that, delete your github account.  Seriously.  Just stop it in its tracks before it becomes a problem.  People build websites for fun, and I still think it's good entertainment, but you need to exercise restraint.  If you can't do that, just stick to C.
